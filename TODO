Current approach leads to **4 blowup of formulae depending on schema size

new approach:

find simple loops, get their lengths, give them ids (map ids to lengths, store them)
loopid = enum value telling loop size
looptype = two bools encoding begin, end, in, out

use propagation for loop length and within/outside of loop stuff


-> reduce int usage (search domain), reduce nested quantification
